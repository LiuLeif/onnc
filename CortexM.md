# ONNC-CortexM Backend

## Overview

This is a joint project created by Skymizer Taiwan Inc. and SSLAB in the National Chung Cheng University. The goal is to create a Cortext-M backend to support the the [mnist model](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/classification/mnist) integrated with the [CMSIS-NN library](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5) running on a Cortext-M microproessor.
